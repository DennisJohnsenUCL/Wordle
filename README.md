This is a project I have been developing throughout my 1st semester of Academy Profession degree studies in Computer Science (datamatiker). I chose Wordle as it presented the opportunity to implement many different ideas and concepts. Listed below are some hand-picked highlights, with links to relevant folders or files in the project.

-[Using class libraries for common classes: WordleCore](WordleCore)

-[WinForms](Wordle_WinForms/)

-[A generic NavigationController class for WinForms](Wordle_WinForms/Controllers/NavigationController.cs)

-Interfaces and Dependency Injection: [Wordle_Console](Wordle_Console/Program.cs), [WordleSolver](WordleSolver/Program.cs)

-Iterating on and improving algorithms (work in progress): [WordleSolver](WordleSolver/Solvers/)

-[Testing using MSTest](WordleCore.Tests/)
